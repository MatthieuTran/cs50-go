# Speller

## tl;dr

Implement a program that spell-checks a file, a la the below, using a hash table.

```
$ ./speller texts/lalaland.txt
MISSPELLED WORDS

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT

WORDS MISSPELLED:
WORDS IN DICTIONARY:
WORDS IN TEXT:
TIME IN load:
TIME IN check:
TIME IN size:
TIME IN unload:
TIME IN TOTAL:
```

## Distribution

### Understanding

Theoretically, on input of size _n_, an algorithm with a running time of _n_ is "asymptotically equivalent," in terms of _O_, to an algorithm with a running time of _2n_. Indeed, when describing the running time of an algorithm, we typically focus on the dominant (i.e., most impactful) term (i.e., _n_ in this case, since _n_ could be much larger than 2). In the real world, though, the fact of the matter is that _2n_ feels twice as slow as _n_.

The challenge ahead of you is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By "fastest," though, we’re talking actual "wall-clock," not asymptotic, time.

## Specification

Alright, the challenge now before you is to implement, in order, `load`, `size`, `check`, and `unload` as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that `TIME IN load`, `TIME IN check`, `TIME IN size`, and `TIME IN unload` are all minimized. To be sure, it’s not obvious what it even means to be minimized, inasmuch as these benchmarks will certainly vary as you feed `speller` different values for dictionary and for text. But therein lies the challenge, if not the fun, of this problem. This problem is your chance to design. Although we invite you to minimize space, your ultimate enemy is time. But before you dive in, some specifications from us.
